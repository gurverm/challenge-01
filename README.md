# HTML-CSS-Accessibility 

## Description

This project required the understanding of semantic HTML elements in order to improve the web accessibility of a webpage. The webpage was created through the use of both HTML and CSS. Starter code was provided and changes were made on both the HTML and CSS files.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Web inspecting the code it will be found that in the HTML file there are semantic structural elements that have been added or improved upon in comparison to the starter code. The CSS files have been ordered in a semantic way that showcases code in order of its appearance in the webpage.

Horiseon, the webpage that is now more accessible, is a social solution service that provides users with information pertaining to search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. 

The following screenshot is an example of the use of semantic elements taken from the HTML file. First there is a figure element added to the largest image on the webpage, which was lacking in the starter code. Next, seen under main, the section element had been given an id and class which allows the webpage navigation links to move the page to the desired section when clicked upon.
